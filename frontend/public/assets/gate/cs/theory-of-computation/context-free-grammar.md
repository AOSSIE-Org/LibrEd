**Context-Free Grammar**
========================

**Introduction**
---------------

A context-free grammar (CFG) is a formal grammar that generates a language through a set of production rules. It is called "context-free" because each non-terminal can be replaced by any possible string of terminals, without considering the surrounding context.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### Definition 1: Context-Free Grammar

A context-free grammar $G = (V, Σ, P, S)$ consists of:

*   A set of **non-terminals** $V$.
*   A set of **terminals** $\Sigma$.
*   A set of **production rules** $P$, where each rule is of the form $A \rightarrow \alpha$, with $A$ a non-terminal and $\alpha$ a string of terminals and/or non-terminals.
*   A **start symbol** $S$, which is a designated non-terminal.

### Definition 2: Derivation

A derivation in a context-free grammar $G$ is a sequence of production rules applied to the start symbol. For example, if we have the following production rules:

$$
\begin{align*}
S &\rightarrow AB \\
A &\rightarrow a \\
B &\rightarrow b
\end{align*}
$$

Then one possible derivation is $S \Rightarrow AB \Rightarrow ab$.

### Definition 3: Language Generated by a Context-Free Grammar

The **language generated** by a context-free grammar $G$ is the set of all strings that can be derived from the start symbol using the production rules in $P$. We denote this language as $L(G)$.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

### Theorem 1: Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages

Let $L$ be a context-free language. Then there exists an integer $p \geq 1$ such that every string $w \in L$ with length at least $p$ can be written as $w = xyz$, where:

*   $x, y, z$ are non-empty strings.
*   $|xy| \leq p$.
*   For all $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in L$.

### Corollary 1: Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages (Simple Form)

If a string $w \in L(G)$ with length at least $p$ can be written as $w = xyz$, where:

*   $x, y, z$ are non-empty strings.
*   $|xy| \leq p$.

Then for all $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in L(G)$.

**Problem Solving Patterns**
-----------------------------

### Pattern 1: Finding the Language Generated by a Context-Free Grammar

To find the language generated by a context-free grammar, we need to identify the production rules and apply them recursively to the start symbol. We can use the following steps:

1.  Identify the production rules.
2.  Apply the production rules to the start symbol to derive strings.

### Pattern 2: Using the Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages

To prove that a language is not context-free, we can use the pumping lemma. The basic idea is to show that there exists a string in the language with length at least $p$ that cannot be written in the required form.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

### Example 1: Finding the Language Generated by a Context-Free Grammar

Consider the following context-free grammar:

$$
\begin{align*}
S &\rightarrow AB \\
A &\rightarrow aA \mid b \\
B &\rightarrow cB \mid d
\end{align*}
$$

Find the language generated by this grammar.

Solution:

1.  Identify the production rules.
2.  Apply the production rules to the start symbol $S$:
    $$S \Rightarrow AB \Rightarrow aAbcBd \Rightarrow abcd$$

The language generated by this grammar is $\{abcd\}$.

### Example 2: Using the Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages

Consider the following context-free language:

$$L = \{a^n b^n c^n d^n \mid n \geq 1\}$$

Show that $L$ is not context-free using the pumping lemma.

Solution:

1.  Assume that $L$ is context-free.
2.  Apply the pumping lemma to get a string $w \in L$ with length at least $p$, where:
    *   $x, y, z$ are non-empty strings.
    *   $|xy| \leq p$.
3.  Write $w = xyz$ and apply the production rules to derive a new string $w' = xy^iz$.
4.  Show that $w' \notin L$, which contradicts the assumption that $L$ is context-free.

**Common Pitfalls**
-------------------

*   **Incorrect application of the pumping lemma**: Make sure to follow the correct format and steps when applying the pumping lemma.
*   **Inadequate analysis of the production rules**: Carefully examine the production rules and their implications on the language generated by the grammar.

**Quick Summary**
