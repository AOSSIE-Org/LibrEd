**Calculus Theory Notes**
=========================

### Introduction
-----------------

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of continuous change, particularly in the context of functions and limits. It has numerous applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and computer science.

### Core Concepts
-----------------

#### Limits
------------

The limit of a function $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches a value $a$, denoted by $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$, is the value that the function approaches as it gets arbitrarily close to $a$. If the limit exists, we say that the function has a limit at that point.

#### Differentiation
------------------

Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function. The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $a$ is denoted by $f'(a)$. It represents the rate of change of the function with respect to $x$ at that point.

#### Integration
----------------

Integration is the process of finding the definite integral of a function. The definite integral of a function $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is denoted by $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$. It represents the area under the curve of the function between the limits $a$ and $b$.

### Key Formulas/Theorems
---------------------------

*   **Power Rule**: If $f(x)=x^n$, then $f'(x)=nx^{n-1}$.
*   **Product Rule**: If $f(x) = u(x)v(x)$, then $f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x)$.
*   **Quotient Rule**: If $f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}$, then $f'(x) = \frac{u'(x)v(x)-u(x)v'(x)}{(v(x))^2}$.
*   **Chain Rule**: If $f(x) = g(h(x))$, then $f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \cdot h'(x)$.

### Problem Solving Patterns
-----------------------------

1.  **Identify the function and its limits**: Carefully read the problem statement to identify the function and its limits.
2.  **Apply differentiation rules**: Use the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, or chain rule as applicable to find the derivative of the function.
3.  **Evaluate integrals**: Use the fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate definite integrals.

### Examples with Solutions
---------------------------

#### Example 1

Find $\int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx$

Solution:

$\int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^2$

$= \frac{2^3}{3}-\frac{0^3}{3}$

$= \frac{8}{3}$

#### Example 2

Find the derivative of $f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1$

Solution:

$f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$

### Common Pitfalls
---------------------

*   **Incorrect application of differentiation rules**: Be careful to apply the correct rule for differentiation.
*   **Failure to evaluate limits**: Make sure to carefully evaluate the limits before finding derivatives or integrals.

### Quick Summary
-----------------

*   Limits, differentiation, and integration are fundamental concepts in calculus.
*   Use power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule for differentiation.
*   Apply fundamental theorem of calculus for evaluating definite integrals.
