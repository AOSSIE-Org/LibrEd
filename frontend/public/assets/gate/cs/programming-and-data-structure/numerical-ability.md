**Numerical Ability - Programming and Data Structures**
=====================================================

### Introduction

Numerical ability is a crucial aspect of programming and data structures, focusing on problem-solving skills with numbers. This section will cover key concepts, formulas, and patterns required to tackle numerical-based questions in the GATE CS exam.

### Core Concepts

#### 1. **Percentages**

*   **Discount and Marked Price**: Calculate discounts using the formula: Discount = (Marked Price - Selling Price) / Marked Price
*   **Percentage Change**: Understand that percentage change is calculated as ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) \* 100

#### 2. **Simple Interest**

*   **Interest Rate**: Use the formula I = PRT, where I is interest, P is principal amount, R is rate of interest, and T is time period
*   **Time Period**: Understand that when comparing interests, time periods must be in the same units

#### 3. **Ratio and Proportion**

*   **Direct Proportionality**: Use the formula y = kx, where k is a constant of proportionality
*   **Inverse Proportionality**: Use the formula xy = constant

### Key Formulas/Theorems

*   $\boxed{\text{Selling Price} = \frac{\text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit}}{(1 + \text{Taxes Rate})}}$
*   $\boxed{\text{Simple Interest} = PRT}$

### Problem Solving Patterns

*   **Algebraic Manipulation**: Apply algebraic techniques to simplify expressions and solve equations
*   **Number System**: Understand the properties of integers, fractions, decimals, and percentages
*   **Logical Reasoning**: Use logic diagrams or Venn diagrams to visualize relationships between variables

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 1:**
A shopkeeper sells two products at a profit of 10% each. If one product is sold for Rs.100, what is the total profit made?

Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
For Product 1: 100 = Cost Price \* (1 + 0.1)
Cost Price = 90.91
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price = 100 - 90.91 = 9.09

**Example 2:**
A car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 60 km/h and returns with an average speed of 40 km/h. What is the ratio of the time taken for the return journey to the time taken for the onward journey?

Time = Distance / Speed
Let distance be x km.
Onward Journey: Time = x / 60
Return Journey: Time = x / 40

Ratio of Return to Onward Time = (x / 40) : (x / 60)
= 3:2

### Common Pitfalls

*   **Incorrect Units**: Ensure that all units are consistent when comparing quantities.
*   **Missing Formulas**: Understand the underlying formulas and apply them correctly.
*   **Insufficient Analysis**: Take the time to analyze each problem thoroughly.

### Quick Summary

*   Percentages: Discount, Percentage Change
*   Simple Interest: Interest Rate, Time Period
*   Ratio and Proportion: Direct Inverse Proportionality
*   Algebraic Manipulation: Simplify expressions, solve equations
*   Number System: Integers, Fractions, Decimals, Percentages
*   Logical Reasoning: Visualize relationships between variables
