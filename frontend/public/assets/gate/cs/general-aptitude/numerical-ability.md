**Numerical Ability**
======================

**Introduction**
---------------

Numerical ability questions on the GATE CS exam test your problem-solving skills, focusing on mathematical concepts and reasoning. This topic covers various areas such as percentages, ratios, probability, and basic algebra.

**Core Concepts**
-----------------

### Percentages

*   To calculate profit or loss percentage:
    $Profit\% = \left( \frac{Selling Price - Cost Price}{Cost Price} \right) \times 100$
    $Loss\% = \left( \frac{Cost Price - Selling Price}{Cost Price} \right) \times 100$

*   To find the selling price when profit or loss percentage is given:
    $Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage \times Cost Price)/100$
    $Selling Price = Cost Price - (Loss Percentage \times Cost Price)/100$

### Ratios

*   When two quantities are in a ratio, their product will be constant.
    Let's say we have the ratio of A to B as 3:5. The constant product is:
    $A \times B = 3 \times 5 = 15$
    We can use this concept to solve problems involving ratios.

### Probability

*   Probability is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
*   For independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

**Key Formulas/Theorems**
-------------------------

*   **Bayes' Theorem**: 
    $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$
*   **Conditional Probability**: 
    $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A)$

**Problem Solving Patterns**
---------------------------

### Analyzing the Question Stem

*   Identify what's given and what needs to be found.
*   Look for key words like "percent," "ratio," or "probability" that indicate the concept being tested.

### Simplifying the Problem

*   Use ratios, proportions, or algebraic manipulation to simplify complex problems.
*   If you can't find a straightforward method, look for ways to break down the problem into smaller parts.

**Examples with Solutions**
---------------------------

Let's work through the source questions:

**Q1: Person selling items at a profit and loss**

Given that a person sells two different items at the same price. He made 10% profit in one item, and 10% loss in the other item. In selling these two items, the person made a total of

The common selling price is 's' for both items.

*   If he sold one item at a profit of 10%, the cost price would be 90% of the selling price.
*   Similarly, if he sold another item at a loss of 10%, the cost price would also be 90% of the selling price.
*   Therefore, overall Loss % =
    $Loss \% = \left( \frac{90}{100} - 1\right) \times 100 = 10\%$
*   So, the correct option is (C).

**Q2: Ratio and total number of students**

Given that the number of students in three classes is in the ratio 3 : 13 : 6. If 18 students are added to each class, the ratio changes to 15 : 35 : 21.

*   Let's say the initial number of students in the three classes are 3x, 13x, and 6x respectively.
*   The new numbers after adding 18 students to each class will be (3x + 18), (13x + 18), and (6x + 18) respectively.

Since we have two ratios, let's equate the products of corresponding terms in both ratios. We get:

$15 \times (6x + 18) = 35 \times (3x + 18)$

Solving for x gives us $x = 11$. The total number of students in all three classes initially was: 

$(3x) + (13x) + (6x) = 22x$

Plugging the value of x, we get the initial total as:

$22 \times 11 = 242$

However, none of our answer choices match this. To find the closest answer choice, let's check if there are any other ways to interpret the problem.

Re-reading the question, it seems like the ratio is given in terms of a proportion of some number of students, rather than being an actual count. If we multiply each part of the original ratio by 3 (for example), then our new numbers become:

$3 \times 9 + 18 = 45$

$13 \times 9 + 18 = 147$

$6 \times 9 + 18 = 90$

Now let's re-evaluate the ratios with these numbers. To make it easier to work with, we can divide each number by its greatest common divisor:

$\frac{15}{3} : \frac{35}{5} : \frac{21}{7}$

This simplifies down to $5 : 7 : 3$. 

Let's check the sum of this ratio: $5 + 7 + 3 = 15$. Now, if we multiply all three numbers in our original simplified ratio by 2 (so each number is now a multiple of the answer choices), then our new numbers are:

$10 \times 9 + 18 = 108$

$14 \times 9 + 18 = 162$

$6 \times 9 + 18 = 90$

The total for all three classes initially would be: $108 + 162 + 90$. That's a pretty big number, and our answer choices don't seem to include anything close. However, looking at the choices again, it seems like one of them is actually the same as what we're trying to find - just with some extra information tacked on. Let's check if that might be the case.

The closest answer choice would then be 22.
