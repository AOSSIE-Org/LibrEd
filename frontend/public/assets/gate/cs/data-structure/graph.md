**Graph Theory**
================

### Introduction

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used to represent relationships between objects and can be either directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

### Core Concepts

#### Types of Graphs

*   **Undirected Graph**: An edge connects two nodes in both directions.
*   **Directed Graph** (Digraph): An edge connects a node to another node in one direction only.
*   **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights associated with them, representing the cost or distance between nodes.

#### Terminology

*   **Node/Vertex**: A point in the graph represented by a label.
*   **Edge**: A connection between two nodes, possibly weighted.
*   **Neighbor**: A node adjacent to another node through an edge.

### Key Formulas/Theorems

*   **Handshaking Lemma**: The sum of degrees of all vertices in a graph is twice the number of edges ($\sum \deg(v) = 2|E|$).
*   **Tree Properties**:
    *   A tree with $n$ vertices has $(n-1)$ edges.
    *   Adding an edge to a forest results in a tree.

### Problem Solving Patterns

#### Forest Generation and Connected Components

Given the number of edges in a forest generated by DFS traversal, you can determine the number of connected components using the formula:

$$x = \frac{40 + 99}{1}$$

where $x$ is the number of components, and $\frac{40+99}{1}$ simplifies to $\boxed{60}$.

#### Chromatic Number

*   The chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colors required for proper coloring.
*   If the chromatic number is $k$, then:
    *   A complete subgraph with $k$ vertices exists ($A$).
    *   An independent set of size at least $\frac{n}{k}$ exists ($B$).
    *   The graph contains at least $\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ edges ($C$).

#### DFS and BFS Trees

*   In a directed graph, if a DFS tree is also a BFS tree rooted at the same vertex $v$, then there are no forward-edges with respect to the tree.

### Examples with Solutions

**Example 1: Forest Generation**

Given an undirected graph with 100 vertices and 40 edges in its forest generated by DFS traversal:

$$\text{Number of connected components} = \frac{40 + 99}{1} = \boxed{60}$$

**Example 2: Chromatic Number**

Suppose a graph has $n$ vertices, chromatic number $k$, and contains an independent set of size at least $\frac{n}{k}$:

*   The complete subgraph with $k$ vertices exists.
*   A proper coloring requires $k$ colors.

### Common Pitfalls

*   Be cautious when using the Handshaking Lemma; ensure you're dealing with simple graphs (no multiple edges between nodes).
*   In chromatic number problems, be aware of graph properties and how they influence colorability.
*   When comparing DFS and BFS trees, remember that forward-edges are not present in this specific scenario.
